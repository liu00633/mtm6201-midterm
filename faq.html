        <h3>What is the cost of an online ordering system?</h3>
        <h4>Depending on which delivery plan you go with, an ordering ordering system for restaurants can pay for itself in increased revenue or you could be spending a lot of money on fees with a third party. Some third-party delivery companies will take 15-20% of every sale, which may mean you need to raise your prices on that platform to cover the costs. When calculating the costs make sure to account for both monthly fees and transaction fees - it may seem like a great deal to get "free" online ordering in exchange for processing payments, but the rate on that payment processing could be much higher than you could get elsewhere.</h4>

        <h3>Does my restaurant need an online ordering system?</h3>
        <h4>The short answer is "yes." The ability to order online became standard during the pandemic. If your restaurant doesn't have some type of online presence you're likely losing customers to your competitors. The good news is, adding online ordering options doesn't have to be time consuming or expensive.</h4>
